This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom image processing.  The issue is that the image returned from the camera has an unexpected format, causing errors when attempting to process it with libraries like `react-native-image-crop-picker` or similar. Specifically, the image data might be in an unsupported format or contain unexpected metadata that the image processing library cannot handle.
