# Expo Camera: Unexpected Image Format

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API with custom image processing. The image returned by the camera has an unexpected format, leading to errors when processed with libraries like `react-native-image-crop-picker`. 

## Bug Description
The issue stems from inconsistencies in the image data returned by Expo's Camera API.  The format may deviate from what is expected by image processing libraries, resulting in errors during operations like cropping or resizing.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `expo start`.
4. Take a photo using the app.
5. Observe the error in the console when attempting to process the image.

## Solution
The solution involves converting the image to a compatible format before passing it to the image processing library.  This often entails checking the image data format and converting it to a format such as JPEG or PNG.
